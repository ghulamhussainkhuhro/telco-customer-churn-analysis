# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn using a dataset from a telecommunications company. The goal is to uncover patterns and reasons behind customer churn and provide actionable insights for improving customer retention.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Detailed insights into churn drivers.
- Actionable recommendations for retention.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning and transformation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment.

## Dataset Details

- **Source**: Telecommunications customer data.
- **Key Columns**: `customerID`, `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`, `Churn`, etc.
- **Target Variable**: `Churn` (Binary: Yes/No).

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**

   - Handled missing values and duplicates.
   - Transformed binary variables for better interpretability.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**

   - **Churn Rate**: 26.54% of customers churned.
   - **Demographics**: Identified high churn among senior citizens.
   - **Service Usage**: Analyzed the impact of service types on churn.
   - **Payment Methods**: Explored churn trends across payment methods.

3. **Visualizations**

   - Count plots for categorical variables.
   - Pie charts for churn percentage.
   - Histograms for tenure and churn.
   - Subplots for service-specific churn analysis.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**

   - Highlighted key churn drivers like contract types, online security, and payment methods.
   - Suggested actionable steps for customer retention.

## Usage

```markdown
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the analysis:

   - Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells.
```

## Results

- Visualizations showing churn trends.
- Actionable insights for improving retention.

## Future Work

- Incorporate machine learning models to predict customer churn.
- Conduct A/B testing for retention strategies.
